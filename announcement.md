# Proof of Existence open-source release

**April, 05 2018**

### The first fully-functional web service based on Proof of Existence protocol is now open-source!

[Proof of Existence (PoE)](http://proofofexistence.com) is an open-source web application to anonymously and securely store a unique key representing a document using the blockchain.

[Proof of Existence (PoE)](http://proofofexistence.com) is based entirely on open technologies. It relies on multiple software platforms developed both in house and by the community.

By releasing [Proof of Existence](http://proofofexistence.com) to the public, we want to push forward adoption of open technology in the blockchain space.

### How it works

Uploading a document on PoE creates a unique identifier that can be used to certify its existence. This identifier is then stored in the Bitcoin blockchain, associated with a timestamp and anonymous address.

Documents are NOT stored in a database or in the bitcoin blockchain, but you can easily verify the authenticity of any document by generating the identifier again and comparing with the one stored in the blockchain.

Read [the docs](http://proofofexistence.github.io) to learn more and start to deploy your own instance.

### Some history

Proof of Existence is a blockchain protocol that can be used to verify the unicity of a file or document. It was launched in 2013 as an open source project. It was developed by Manuel Araoz and Esteban Ordano. You can read more on [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence).
