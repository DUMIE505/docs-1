# Proof of Existence open-source release

**April, 05 2018**

Proof of Existence is a blockchain protocol that can be used to verify the unicity of a file or document. It was launched in 2013 as an open source project. It was developed by Manuel Araoz and Esteban Ordano. You can read more on [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence).

### How it works

[Proof of Existence (PoE)](http://proofofexistence.com) is a fully functional software to anonymously and securely store a unique key representing a document in the blockchain.

Uploading a document on PoE creates a unique identifier that can be used to certify the existence of this document. This identifier is then stored in the Bitcoin blockchain, associated with a timestamp and anonymous address.

Documents are NOT stored in a database or in the bitcoin blockchain, but you can easily verify the authenticity of any document by generating the identifier again and comparing with the one stored in the blockchain.

### Open-source technologies

The [Proof of Existence (PoE)](http://proofofexistence.com) service is based entirely on open technologies.  

You can read [the docs](http://proofofexistence.github.io) to learn how to run and deploy your own instance.
