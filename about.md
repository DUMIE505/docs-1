What is Proof of Existence?
===========================

Use our service to anonymously and securely store an online distributed
proof of existence for any document. **Your documents are NOT stored in
our database or in the bitcoin blockchain**, so you don\'t have to worry
about your data being accessed by others.

All we store is a [cryptographic
digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of
the file, linked to the time in which you submitted the document. In
this way, you can later certify that the data existed at that time. This
is the first online service allowing you to publicly prove that you have
certain information without revealing the data or yourself, with a
decentralized certification based on the [bitcoin
network](http://bitcoin.org/).

The key advantages are anonymity, privacy, and getting a decentralized
proof which can\'t be erased or modified by anyone (third parties or
governments). **Your document\'s existence is permanently validated by
the blockchain even if this site is compromised or down**, so you don\'t
depend or need to trust any central authority. All previous data
timestamping solutions lack this freedom.
