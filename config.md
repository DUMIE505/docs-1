# Configuration


To get started, you need to create a `local` config file with the
desired values for your instance.

Just copy the `sample-local.yaml` to `local-development.yaml` and edit it.

```sh
cp config/sample-local.yaml config/local-development.yaml
```

We use
[node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files)
to manage config files.

## Config File

**All values are required** - except for mail and nodemailer.

## About wallets

**Note**: You must create two different HD wallets. The first wallet is the
*Incoming* wallet, which is used to generate payment addresses for the user, and
to sign transactions embedding docproofs. The second wallet is the *Outgoing*
wallet, which is used to generate addresses where the change from docproof
transactions is sent.

The private key for the *Incoming* wallet must be the `BITCOIN_HD_PRIVATE_KEY`.

The public key for the *Outoing* wallet must be `BITCOIN_HD_PUBLIC_KEY`. The
private key for the change wallet should be kept secret, and can be used later
to sweep the funds.

You can use [bcwallet](https://github.com/blockcypher/bcwallet/) to easily create a new wallet.
