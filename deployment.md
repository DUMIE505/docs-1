# Deployment with Docker

You can easily deploy and monitor your own instance online using [Docker](https://docker.com)

### Get the image

A [ready-to-use docker build](https://hub.docker.com/r/proofofexistence/proofofexistence/) is available online to download at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/proofofexistence/proofofexistence/).

```sh
docker pull proofofexistence/proofofexistence
```

### Configure your wallet

For the server to start, you will need to pass your config to the Docker image by using a list of environment variables. You will find an example in `.sample-env`.  Please report to the [config](./config) doc for more info about environment variables.

```sh
cp .sample-env .env-docker
```

### Start/stop the image

You can now start your Docker image as daemon.

```sh
docker run -d -i --rm --name proofofexistence --env-file .env-docker -p 3003:3003 proofofexistence:VERSION
```

You can check that the node is running using `docker ps`.

#### Stop the image

```sh
docker stop proofofexistence
```

#### Attach to the docker-node

```sh
docker exec --user node -w /home/node -ti proofofexistence bash
```

## Deployment with [Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)

If you don't know how to use Amazon ECS, you can read the [example](https://medium.com/boltops/gentle-introduction-to-how-aws-ecs-works-with-example-tutorial-cea3d27ce63d) first.

This is the task defination:

## Build the Docker image yourself

You can build the docker image from the `Dockerfile` from within the github rep by using the following command:

```sh
docker build -t proofofexistence .
```

## Install Docker

To install docker, please refer to the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). For OSX users, you can just [install it from brew](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40523307/brew-install-docker-does-not-include-docker-engine).



## Systemd Service

The app can be run as a systemd service with a startup script such as:

```
[Unit]
Description=Proof of Existence prod
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/proofofexistence/
Environment="NODE_ENV=production"
Environment="PORT=3003"
Type=simple
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/ubuntu/proofofexistence/lib/server.js
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
